# NServiceBus.MessagingBridge

NServiceBus.MessagingBridge uses the [Messaging Bridge Pattern](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingBridge.html) to allow NServiceBus endpoints to connect to other endpoints that are using different transports.

The NServiceBus Messaging Bridge is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

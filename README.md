# NServiceBus.MessagingBridge

NServiceBus.MessagingBridge is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

The NServiceBus Messaging Bridge allows NServiceBus endpoints to connect to other endpoints that are not using the same transport using the [Messaging Bridge Pattern](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingBridge.html).

See the [Messaging Bridge documentation](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/bridge) for more details.

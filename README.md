# NServiceBus.MessagingBridge

NServiceBus.MessagingBridge uses the [Messaging Bridge Pattern](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingBridge.html) to allow NServiceBus endpoints to exchange messages between endpoints that are using different transport types or instances.

It is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

See the [Messaging Bridge documentation](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/bridge) for more details.
